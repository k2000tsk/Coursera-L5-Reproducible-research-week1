# coursera_reproducible-research-week1

## Instruction
To practice the plotting techniques you have learned so far, you will be making a graphic that explores relationships between variables. This practice is useful since we will later cover creating reproducible graphics in this class. You will be looking at a subset of a United States medical expenditures dataset with information on costs for different medical conditions and in different areas of the country.

You should do the following:

  1. Make a plot that answers the question: what is the relationship between mean covered charges (Average.Covered.Charges) and mean total payments (Average.Total.Payments) in New York?
  2. Make a plot (possibly multi-panel) that answers the question: how does the relationship between mean covered charges (Average.Covered.Charges) and mean total payments (Average.Total.Payments) vary by medical condition (DRG.Definition) and the state in which care was received (Provider.State)?

## Data
To make the plots use the data in the attached .csv file. These data are a processed version of the data from the site: https://data.cms.gov/Medicare/Inpatient-Prospective-Payment-System-IPPS-Provider/97k6-zzx3
